# GANterpolate (GAN + Interpolate)

Gap-Filling in Satellite Observations Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

A project for gap filling and imputation of missing values in satellite data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The repository demonstrates how to restore missing or corrupted data in satellite imagery or time series using deep learning.

## Features

- GAN-based approach for data imputation and restoration.
- Utilities for generating training data with simulated gaps.
- Example Jupyter notebook for end-to-end workflow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the demo notebook in `notebooks/`.
